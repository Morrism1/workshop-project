Together with GIZ, Rwanda launched an education program to train women for jobs in tech. Once they have successfully completed the program, participants receive ISTQB® certification and are hired by Muraho Technology, a Rwandan software testing company that partners with Betahills. By delivering world-class service on the international market, Muraho is key player in Rwanda’s transition into a tech hub. And by connecting the team at Muraho with European clients, Betahills is helping to empower women to pursue careers in Kigali’s booming IT and technology sector.</p></div>)
